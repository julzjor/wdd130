            Curious to see examples of my previous work or the tools and skills
            I use? Take a look at the list below! Many of these skills were
            self-taught, which means I’m always ready to take on new challenges
            and learn whatever is needed to meet your project’s unique needs.

            <p>
              This is a project I created for the Family Support Center in my
              town. They wanted quite a bit of custimization for this site. I
              added many dynamic and custimizable options for them. The site is
              often updated by them without having to reach out to me and pay me
              every time, thus saving them money and time.

              Also all artwork was given to me by the client, or I found free
              images, but I used Photoshop to color them all with a blue hue to
              make the site visually appealing.

            <p>
              Cedar Music Store was a fun site to build. We went with bright
              colors on a black background and used some different shapes and
              fonts for this website. I love how it turned out. This site also
              wanted some features to be able to add on to. So I used wordpress
              and some dynamic custom fields so they are able to add to it very
              easily.

              The artwok was mainly created by me. I found some of it on freepik
              then changed colors to match our color scheme.

            <p>
              Sadly, this website does not exist anymore. I was learning to
              create websites at this time and this website turned out so
              beautiful! Pamela is the designer of the bridal and temple gowns
              in the site. Pamela also happens to be my mother. I made MANY
              customizations for this client because there were so many details
              about the dresses that were important. We had landing pages for
              all the dresses plus made very feminine pages for the individual
              gowns with details about colors and lace options. My mother sold
              this business and the business still exists, but they decided to
              redo the site their own way, which is fine, but this site was
              beautiful when it was up.

              Also all artwork was given to me by the client. I also built the
              logo with Photoshop and Illustrator and the decorations on the
              pages were created by me as well.

              This is the first website I did as a web developer. I still think
              it looks great! They had their logo set already so it was easier
              to choose colors. The client wanted the header to have contact
              infomation in it so that it was the main thing on the site:
              contact info.

              would help with the website.

              Interestingly enough, this website was created for, and at the
              same time, the Cedar City Auto clients. They owned both
              businesses, often using the businesses in conjunction with each
              other, but often using them separately for separate clients. We
              had to figure out a way to make them seem connected but separate.
              The client also had SO MANY before and after images of their work,
              so we made sure to have a gallery that highlighted that! Plus
              individual project pages.

              Also all artwork was given to me by the client. Client was able to
              add as many projects as they wanted with the back end that was
              easy to use.

            <p>
              This was such a fun project. This client had a brilliant idea for
              shipping: to have an app and if people were travelling to and from
              an area, they list it on the app and other people can use them for
              shipping, especially useful for farmers needing to rent equipment,
              etc. It was such a fun idea and it stands for Make A Difference
              Freight. They had the app, we just needed to market it. This was
              my first website where we made a video for the home page. I love
              how it turned out. We made instruction pages for using the app. We
              made advertisement pages. It's such a great website with some fun
              css animations on the home page and elsewhere!
