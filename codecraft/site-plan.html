      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I am proposing a portfolio website. I want to have a site that tells potential employers and others my skills. I will use this site for any future job applications and resumes. </p>
        <p>My vision is for a great HOME page that is very eye catching and simple that lists my skills and the languages I know in tech. </p>
          <p>My second page I want to have a great CONTACT ME page with a form to fill out, and my business email address. I could use this page to list my resume, and past employers. </p>
            <p>My third page will be for PROJECTS. I would love to showcase some of the projects I’ve done in the past for web and also other coding projects such as in python, etc. I will figure out a way to develop a nice image text box and repeat it so it makes sense for each project I decide to list. </p>
         </p>  <!-- change this -->

        <h4>Hello, I'm Julie</h4> 
        <p>Growing up, technology wasn’t even on my radar—because it didn’t exist as it does now!
