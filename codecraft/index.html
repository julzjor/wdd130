          <h1>Hi,</h1>
          <h1>I'm Julie.</h1>
          <p>
            With a passion for both code and aesthetics, I create beautifully
            functional websites that blend creativity with technical expertise.
            I thrive in bringing visually appealing ideas to life through code
            and enjoy working closely with clients to make their visions a
            reality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Growing up before modern technology, I gained a unique perspective
            that helps me understand the needs of middle-aged and older clients
            while staying current with the latest trends valued by younger
            generations.
          </p>
          <p>
            My background as a tech specialist in an educational setting has
            honed my skills in troubleshooting, problem-solving, and
            preventative maintenance, which translates into delivering reliable
            and efficient digital solutions. If a challenge arises, I’m
            committed to finding a solution, leveraging my strong work ethic,
            creativity, and technical expertise.
