        The cityscape unfolds in a stunning panorama, with modern and historic
        buildings rising along the river’s edge, casting shimmering reflections
        on the water below. A grand stone bridge stretches across the river, its
        arches illuminated by soft, golden lights as evening falls, connecting
        bustling neighborhoods on either side. The skyline is dotted with
        twinkling lights as office towers and apartments light up, creating a
        warm glow against the deepening blue of the sky. Along the waterfront,
        the faint sounds of the city—a distant car horn, a laugh, a passing
        boat—blend into a gentle urban melody. The river flows steadily beneath
        the bridge, its surface smooth and calm, carrying the city’s quiet
        energy forward.
