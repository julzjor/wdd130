    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <p style="margin-right: 70%">
      My name is Julie. I have done professional web development and look foward
      to learning more to make myself more marketable. I am currently a tech at
      an Early College High School in Southern Utah.

    <p style="margin-right: 70%">
      My main loves in my life are my family. I have been married to my husband
      for 30 years. We met at BYUI, but it was called Rick's College back in the
      day. We are a super musical family. All my kids are grown and gone and do
      music professionally or do music at college. My husband is a music teacher
      in Southern Utah as well.
    </p>
    <p>My other loves are MUSIC, biking, puzzles, and board and card games.</p>
